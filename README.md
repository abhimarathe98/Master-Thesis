**Development of Simulation for Communication-Aware Motion Planning of Multi-Robot Systems in Multi-Network Areas**

**Introduction**
This thesis addresses the integration of autonomous robotic systems in logistics, focusing on their application in warehousing and airport operations. The primary goal is to develop a simulation for communication-aware motion planning in multi-robot systems operating across multi-network areas, aiming to enhance efficiency and reliability in such environments.

**Problem Definition**
The thesis identifies key challenges in transitioning from classical motion planning to communication-aware motion planning. Issues include communication latency, dynamic network conditions, scalability, and collision avoidance. The focus is on developing robust communication protocols and adaptive algorithms to address these challenges in multi-warehouse robot systems.

**Objectives**
The thesis is structured around five mandatory tasks and two optional tasks:
1. Develop a multi-robot motion planning simulation environment in MATLAB/Python/C++.
2. Research existing frameworks for communication-aware motion planning in warehousing.
3. Explore simulation tools for multi-robot systems.
4. Investigate multi-robot path planning in multi-network zones.
5. Compare various path planning algorithms and select the most effective one.
6. (Optional) Investigate mmWave applications for communication-aware motion planning.
7. (Optional) Assess the feasibility of 5G/6G mobile network technology.

**Proposed Approach**

**Environment Setup** - Define the warehouse layout using a suitable data structure like a grid or graph. This representation helps in visualizing the navigation area for robots.

**Robot Models** - Develop models for robots, including their kinematics, dynamics, sensors, and actuators. This involves creating structures to represent individual robots and their properties.

**Motion Planning Algorithm** - Implement suitable algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra, MILP, and RRT for motion planning in warehouse environments. The thesis will evaluate these algorithms based on factors like collision avoidance and communication requirements.

**Communication Model** - Define a model for robots to exchange information over WiFi, focusing on minimal interference and congestion. This involves selecting appropriate channels and optimizing communication quality.

**Simulation Execution and Optimization** - Implement a simulation loop where robots interact with the environment, plan paths, and communicate. Optimize the simulation for efficiency and evaluate performance using metrics such as path length and collision avoidance.

**Conclusion** - This thesis aims to bridge the gap between classical and communication-aware motion planning for multi-robot systems. By integrating real-time communication capabilities, the research seeks to optimize operations in logistics environments, such as airports and warehouses, enhancing overall system performance
